## Hardware changes

The most important hardware change is the addition of an RS-485 interface with two RJ-45 connectors instead of the RS-232 interface. RS-485 has better properties allowing it to work in more difficult conditions. The parameters of the RS-485 interface can be hardware controlled by means of S1 switches.

The entire power section was also rebuilt by changing the +/- 12V converter from Traco to Aimtec. The converters now have individual 24V power circuits with a separate fuse and a LED indicator for the burnout status.

## Firmware changes

The software has undergone general cleanup. The layout of the program has been changed, although its functionality has remained almost completely unchanged.

The most important change was the implementation of the MODBUS protocol which replaced text communication over RS-232.
