## About

The hardware for the SCX3 controller was developed using the EAGLE 7.7.0 environment.

## Status

The project has not been developed for a long time and the content of the repository has not been checked. Therefore, there is no guarantee that the project files will generate a PCB without any additional steps.

Additionally, this hardware version (1.2.0) has not been tested on the built prototype.

The only version tested on a prototype is 1.0.0 - which contained bugs that were fixed in later versions.
