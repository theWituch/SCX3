## Prototype

![PCB prototype](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theWituch/ServoControllerX3/1.0.0/Hardware/PCB/Prototype.jpg)
*There are no '21' connector soldered.*

The prototype showed design errors (wrongly arranged descriptions, swapped pin in the ENCODER1 encoder plug and badly designed READY relay power supply). However, this was not an obstacle to testing and developing the firmware.
